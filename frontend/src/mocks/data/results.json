OCO-3 and STP-H6 will be delivered to the International Space Station on SpaceX’s 17th Commercial Resupply Services mission (CRS-17) for NASA. STP-H6 is an x-ray communication investigation that will be used to perform a space-based demonstration of a new technology for generating beams of modulated x-rays. This technology may be useful for providing efficient communication to deep space probes, or communicating with hypersonic vehicles where plasma sheaths prevent traditional radio communications. OCO-3 will be robotically installed on the exterior of the space station’s Japanese Experiment Module Exposed Facility Unit, where it will measure and map carbon dioxide from space to provide further understanding of the relationship between carbon and climate. CRS-17 is scheduled to launch from Space Launch Complex 40 on Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in late April. "

The payloads will be carried to the International Space Station on SpaceX's 15th Commercial Resupply Services mission. ECOSTRESS will measure the temperature of plants and use that information to better understand how much water plants need and how they respond to stress. The Canadian Space Agency is supplying LEE for the Canadarm2 as a spare to replace a failed unit removed by astronauts during a spacewalk in 2017. Each end of the Canadarm2 robotic arm has an identical LEE, which acts like a \"hand\" to grapple payloads and visiting cargo spaceships."
